## User's Guide

1) Run this Bluetooth速 Low Energy Generic Health Sensor project where the STM32WBA will advertise

2) Use the ANDROID/IOS ST BLE Sensor application or ST BLE Toolbox application to connect with this Bluetooth速 Low Energy [Generic Health Sensor Profile 1.0](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/ghsp-1-0/) (GHS_XX where XX is the 2 last digit of the Bluetooth速 Device Address)
  
   After Connection and Selecting the [Generic Health Sensor Profile 1.0](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/ghsp-1-0/) on ANDROID/IOS you will see all the GHS Characteristics.
	
3) Use terminal programs like Tera Term to see the logs of each board via the onboard ST-Link. (115200/8/1/n)
